CSS Byebye
===========

Is a node module that lets you remove the CSS rules that contain the selectors you provide, from your stylesheet.

CSS Byebye is very simple: give him a list of selectors that you want to exclude and it will remove them from your CSS.

CSS Byebye is built with https://github.com/postcss/postcss.

I've found some cases where this approach is easier than using more powerful tools like uncss.
Use what's best for you and give some feedback :)
